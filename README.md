## DashDonate.org

When I was first diagnosed I was always supported by charities. One of the things that I found was that smaller charities never had anyone to help them, and lots of them go bankrupt.

**My mission** was to make it easier for charities to receive donations and raise awareness about the impact they make.

The plan to deliver on my mission by creating a web-based donation dashboard, in which it will offer both resources to train charity staff members, and a low-cost donation collection and administration service.

The goal was to make it easier and more cost-effective to raise awareness about the work a charity does.

I launched **DashDonate.org** just before my second surgery, and was super excited (just before my misdiagnosis info was given).

Millions of pounds (in the first year) wouldâ€™ve been given to charities thanks to DashDonate.org!

â€”

In 2021, I was hoping to re-launch **DashDonate.org** and support loads of charities - sadly, Iâ€™ll not around doing that stuff soon ðŸ˜©

â€”

So all of the code that I wrote DashDonate.org and all of the code, and business plans (just all the info) that will be posted on this project.

I hope that anyone who wants to learn how to code, or someone that would like to make a Charity support tool likes this stuff!

Just to let you know some of the code might be good (most of it), though some may be bad ðŸ˜…

Just have fun!

(Feel free to send an email about the code before I pass - hello@ryancastle.co.uk)
