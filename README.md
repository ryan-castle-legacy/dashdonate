## DashDonate.org

![DashDonate.org Logo](https://github.com/ryan-castle-legacy/dashdonate/blob/main/Logo.png)

When I was first diagnosed I was always supported by charities. One of the things that I found was that smaller charities never had anyone to help them, and lots of them go bankrupt.

**My mission** was to make it easier for charities to receive donations and raise awareness about the impact they make.

The plan to deliver on my mission by creating a web-based donation dashboard, in which it will offer both resources to train charity staff members, and a low-cost donation collection and administration service.

The goal was to make it easier and more cost-effective to raise awareness about the work a charity does.

I launched **DashDonate.org** just before my second surgery, and was super excited (just before my misdiagnosis info was given).

Millions of pounds (in the first year) would’ve been given to charities thanks to DashDonate.org!

—

In 2021, I was hoping to re-launch **DashDonate.org** and support loads of charities - sadly, I’ll not around doing that stuff soon 😩

—

So all of the code that I wrote DashDonate.org and all of the code, and business plans (just all the info) that will be posted on this project.

I hope that anyone who wants to learn how to code, or someone that would like to make a Charity support tool likes this stuff!

—

Just to let you know some of the code might be good (most of it), though some may be bad 😅

Just have fun!

(Feel free to send an email about the code before I pass - hello@ryancastle.co.uk)

Any funding will be used to keep my website up and running so that others can be inspired by my legacy, stories, and the blog.
